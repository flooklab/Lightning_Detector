! ! ! ! ! WARNING ! ! ! ! !

Do NOT actually use Lightning Detector as a serious device to warn you about lightnings or thunderstorms!
It might be that lightnings will NOT be detected and that you will NOT be notified about present or
approaching thunderstorms. You have to assume that the device is inherently UNSAFE and does NOT
work properly. There is NO guarantee for the fitness for any particular purpose whatsoever.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES should you trust the information provided (or not provided) by the device.
Lightning Detector might NOT be tested thoroughly enough and is NOT even intended to be a reliable detector device.
Note that being in a thunderstorm (especially without sufficient protection around you (such as a building))
is a very dangerous situation as you might suddenly be struck by lightning, which is potentially LIFE-THREATENING.
Generally, you should always try to combine multiple sources of information to assess the current risk of thunderstorms
and lightning strikes. Check the weather forecast and watch the sky. Dark clouds can be an early indicator.
If in doubt (or when there is/are audible thunder or visible lightnings at the latest), please seek shelter!
